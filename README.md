Scorekeeper

Simple react app to keep tabs of scores on round based games.

After running out of paper in our house, due to them being filled with scoresheets for card games me and my friends played, I decided to just write a simple React app to save the environment.

You can view a running example of the app at [http://keepscores.surge.sh/](http://keepscores.surge.sh/)
