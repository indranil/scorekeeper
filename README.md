## Scorekeeper
---

Simple react app to keep tabs of scores on round based games.

After running out of paper in our house, due to them being filled with scoresheets for card games me and my friends played, I decided to just write a simple React app to save the environment.

You can view a running example of the app at [http://keepscores.surge.sh/](http://keepscores.surge.sh/)

### TODOS:

* ~~Dialog box when clicking Finish Game~~
* ~~Saving the data to local storage so that you can refresh the page~~
* Maybe more options? Perhaps a win/lose condition.
* Fixed header when scrolling past long lists, so player names always stay on top
* Display score on round when hovering over a row
* A large screen mode? (maybe!)
* A remote desktop mode (update on phone, display on TV / monitor)
